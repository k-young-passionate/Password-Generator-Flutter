<new card>What are the expectations?
<contents>
1. You can get a strong password with easy memorization. You can get the same one on this page. 
2. If you stole a password for one of the web sites, your other password would be safe. 
3. If one of your passwords has been exposed to someone for a moment, it's not easy to remember so that
your password might be safe.
<new card>Keep in Mind!
<contents>
Do not expose your "Easywords" and especially "Password." 
If those things are exposed, your strong passwords will become very weak.
